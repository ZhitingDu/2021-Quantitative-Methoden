1 Which R code is the right one to get the following histogram?

Dataset: mpg

ggplot(mpg,aes(x=hwy)) + geom_histogram(bins=20,fill='red',alpha=0.5)
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=hwy)) + geom_histogram(bins=20,fill='red')
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=hwy)) + geom_histogram(bins=40,fill='red',alpha=0.5)
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=hwy)) + geom_histogram(bins=40,fill='red')
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=hwy)) + geom_histogram(bins=20)

2 The dataset we use for this question is still "mpg".If we want to describe, 
How many cars each manufacturer has according to the number of cyl, using bar plot distinguished by different colors. Which the following code can achieve that ?

ggplot(mpg,aes(x=manufacturer)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(cyl))) 
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=manufacturer)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=cyl)) 
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=manufacturer)) + geom_histogrm(aes(fill=factor(cyl))) 
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=manufacturer)) + geom_histogrm(aes(fill=cyl))
None of these

3 Which R code is the right one to get the following plot?

Dataset: txhousing

ggplot(txhousing,aes(x=sales,y=volume)) + geom_point(color='blue',alpha=0.5)
ggplot(txhousing,aes(x=sales,y=volume)) + geom_point(color='blue')
ggplot(txhousing,aes(x=sales,y=volume)) + geom_point(alpha=0.5)
ggplot(txhousing,aes(x=sales,y=volume)) + geom_col(color='blue',alpha=0.5)
None of these

4 Continue to the last question. What do we need to add in order to draw a red color trend line based on the last scatterplot ?


geom_smooth(color='red')
geom_line(color='red')
geom_abline(color='red')
geom_curve(color='red')
None of these

5 If we want to convert the left plot to the right plot, which the following R code will make it happen?

coord_flip()
coord_quickmap()
coord_polar()
coord_map()
coord_flixed()

6  If we want to set the aspect ratio of the diagram(default is 1:1), which the following R code will make it happen?

coord_flixed()
coord_flip()
coord_quickmap()
coord_polar()
coord_map()

7 The following table is a research dataset from The Economist that want to explore the relationship between HDI and CPI among each country. HDI: Human Development Index, CPI: Corruption Perceptions Index. If we want to display the correlation between HDI and CPI using scatterplot like the following plot, which the following R code is right ?

Data source from: https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption

pl <- ggplot(df,aes(x=CPI,y=HDI,color=Region)) + geom_point(size=4,shape=1)
pl <- ggplot(df,aes(x=CPI,y=HDI,color=factor(Region))) + geom_point(size=4,shape=1)
pl <- ggplot(df,aes(x=CPI,y=HDI,color=Region)) + geom_density()
pl <- ggplot(df,aes(x=CPI,y=HDI,color=Region)) + geom_col()
pl <- ggplot(df,aes(x=CPI,y=HDI,color=Region)) + geom_hitogram()

8  The following table is a research dataset from The Economist that want to explore the relationship between HDI and CPI among each country. HDI: Human Development Index, CPI: Corruption Perceptions Index. Based on the last question, how can we get the following plot ?

Data source from: https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption

pl2 <- pl + geom_smooth(aes(group=1))
pl2 <- pl + geom_line(aes(group=1))
pl2 <- pl + geom_abline(aes(group=1))
pl2 <- pl + geom_curve(aes(group=1))
None of these

9 The following table is a research dataset from The Economist that want to explore the relationship between HDI and CPI among each country. HDI: Human Development Index, CPI: Corruption Perceptions Index. Based on the last question, we want to add the label of each country in the plot, then which one is right ?

Data source from: https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption

pl2 + geom_text(aes(label=Country))
pl2 + ggtitle(aes(label=Country))
pl2 + scale_x_continuous(aes(label=Country))
pl2 + scale_y_continuous(aes(label=Country))
None of these


10 The following table is a research dataset from The Economist that want to explore the relationship between HDI and CPI among each country. HDI: Human Development Index, CPI: Corruption Perceptions Index. Based on the last question, we want to refine the label, ideally is the following plot we want to display, then how to achieve it?

Hint: To simplify the labels, first, we choose a group of the labels we want to show, like:

pointsToLabel <- c("Russia", "Venezuela", "Iraq", "Myanmar", "Sudan",
                   "Afghanistan", "Congo", "Greece", "Argentina", "Brazil",
                   "India", "Italy", "China", "South Africa", "Spane",
                   "Botswana", "Cape Verde", "Bhutan", "Rwanda", "France",
                   "United States", "Germany", "Britain", "Barbados", "Norway", "Japan",
                   "New Zealand", "Singapore")

Data source from: https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption

pl3 <- pl2 + geom_text(aes(label = Country), color = "gray20", data = subset(df, Country %in% pointsToLabel),check_overlap = TRUE)
pl3 <- pl2 + geom_text(aes(label = Country), color = "gray20", data = select(df, Country %in% pointsToLabel),check_overlap = TRUE)
pl3 <- pl2 + geom_text(aes(label = Country), color = "gray20", data = filtert(df, Country %in% pointsToLabel),check_overlap = TRUE)
pl3 <- pl2 + geom_text(aes(label = Country), color = "gray20", data = slice(df, Country %in% pointsToLabel),check_overlap = TRUE)
None of these
