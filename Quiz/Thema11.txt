1 The following data frame is the part of the dataset "mtcars" from the dyplr package. If we want to get the rows, which the mpg-value is above 21 and the cyl is exactly 4, which the following code is right?


filter(mtcars,mpg>21,cyl==4)
select(mtcars,mpg>21,cyl==4)
slice(mtcars,mpg>21,cyl==4)
distinct(mtcars,mpg>21,cyl==4)
filter(mtcars,mpg>21,cyl=4)


2 Following the last question, rearrange the data frame. It should first be sorted according to cyl and then in descending order according to wt, which the following code is right?

arrange(mtcars,cyl,desc(wt))
arrange(mtcars,desc(wt),cyl)
desc(mtcars,cyl,arrange(wt))
order_by(mtcars,cyl,desc(wt))
order_by(mtcars,desc(wt),cyl)

3 Following the last question, if we want to select the columns contain mpg and hp, then which the following code is right?

select(mtcars,mpg,hp)
filter(mtcars,mpg,hp)
data.frame(mtcars,mpg,hp)
slice(mtcars,mpg,hp)
distinct(mtcars,mpg,hp)

4 Following the last question, choose the only value that the column gear has, then...?
distinct(select(mtcars,gear))
distinct(filter(mtcars,gear))
select(distinct(mtcars,gear))
filter(select(mtcars,gear))
select(filter(mtcars,gear))

5 Following the last question, add a new column "performance" which is divided by the column hp and wt to the dataframe, then which r code is right?

mutate(mtcars,Performance=hp/wt)
add_column(mtcars,Performance=hp/wt)
add_case(mtcars,Performance=hp/wt)
add_count(mtcars,Performance=hp/wt)
transmute(mtcars,Performance=hp/wt)




6 Following the last question, we want to change the name of the column "performance" to "pfm", then which r code is right?

rename(mtcars,Performance=pfm)
add_column(mtcars,Performance=pfm)
add_case(mtcars,Performance=pfm)
add_count(mtcars,Performance=pfm)
transmute(mtcars,Performance=pfm)



7 Following the last question, find the average of the column mpg and remove the NA value, then which r code is right?

summarise(mtcars,avg_mpg=mean(mpg, na.rm=TRUE))
mean(mtcars,avg_mpg=summarise(mpg,na.rm=TRUE))
add_count(mtcars,avg_mpg=mean(mpg))
summarise(mtcars,avg_mpg=add_count(mpg))
mutate(mtcars,avg_mpg=mean(mpg)) 

8 Following the last question, using the pipe operator to get the mean of the hp which the cyl is 6, then which r code is right?

mtcars %>% filter(cyl==6) %>% summarise(avg_hp = mean(hp))
mtcars %>% select(cyl==6) %>% summarise(avg_hp = mean(hp))
mtcars %>% summarise(cyl==6) %>% summarise(avg_hp = mean(hp))
mtcars %>% summarise(cyl==6) %>% filter(avg_hp = mean(hp))
mtcars %>% filter(cyl==6) %>% select(avg_hp = mean(hp))

9 If we want to randomly from the dataset mtcars take out 10 rows of the data, then which r code is right?
sample_n(mtcars,10)
sample_frac(flights,10)
slice(flights,10)
select(flights,10)
filter(flights,10)

10 If we want to randomly from the dataset mtcars take out 5% the data, then which r code is right?

sample_frac(mtcars,0.05)
sample_n(flights,0.05)
slice(flights,0.05)
select(flights,0.05)
filter(flights,0.05)
