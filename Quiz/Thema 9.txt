1 Which the following statement of Adjusted R-squared is right?

When there are one more variables, to get a better estimate, we use the Adjusted R-squared to determine how fit the model is
Sometimes we would find that the Adjusted R-squared is optimistic
When there is only k=1 predictors, Adjusted R-squared is not close to regular R-squared
When there is only k=1 predictors, we would rather use regular R-squared to determine than the Adjusted R-squared
None of these is right



2 Which is not the criteria to select a model?

The amount of the variables
Adjustiertes R-Quadrat
p-values
AIC
BIC


3 Which the following statement is right to select a model?

Adjustiertes R-Quadrat describes the strength of a model fit
The best model is always the most complicated
Forward selection starts with the full model.
Backward elimination is the reverse of the backward elimination technique, we add variables one-at-a-time until we cannot find any variables that improve the model any further
None of these is right


4 If we have a linear model running in R: 
testmodel <- lm(absichtni~IQ+Motivation, data=data_xls), and have the following result, which the following option describe this model?

Absichtni = 7.558010 - 0.039215*IQ - 0.139323*Motivation + error
Absichtni = 0.039215 - 7.558010 *IQ - 0.139323*Motivation + error
Absichtni = 0.139323 - 0.039215*IQ - 7.558010 *Motivation + error
Absichtni = 0.139323 - 7.558010*IQ - 0.139323*Motivation + error
Absichtni = 7.558010 - 0.039215*IQ - 7.558010*Motivation + error




5 This dataset is aimed to discover the demand of bike sharing. Forecast use of a city bikeshare system.If we want to know how the factors: "atemp" and "casual" affect the "count", what the following multiple regression model shall we establish?


datetime - hourly date + timestamp  
season -  1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter 
holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday
workingday - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday
weather - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog 
temp - temperature in Celsius
atemp - "feels like" temperature in Celsius
humidity - relative humidity
windspeed - wind speed
casual - number of non-registered user rentals initiated
registered - number of registered user rentals initiated
count - number of total rentals


Data source :https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data

count = b0+b1*casual+b2*atemp
casual = b0+b1*casual+b2*atemp
atemp = b0+b1*count+b2*atemp
count = b1*casual+b2*atemp
None of these is right




6 This dataset is aimed to discover the demand of bike sharing. Forecast use of a city bikeshare system.If we want to know how the factors: "atemp" and "casual" affect the "count", what the following multiple regression model shall we establish in R?


datetime - hourly date + timestamp  
season -  1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter 
holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday
workingday - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday

3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog 
temp - temperature in Celsius
atemp - "feels like" temperature in Celsius
humidity - relative humidity
windspeed - wind speed
casual - number of non-registered user rentals initiated
registered - number of registered user rentals initiated
count - number of total rentals


Data source :https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data

lm(count ~  casual+ atemp, data=bikeshare)
lm(casaul ~  casual+ atemp, data=bikeshare)
lm(atemp ~  casual+ atemp, data=bikeshare)
lm(count ~  casual+ atemp + count, data=bikeshare)
None of these is right



7 Which the following statement of logistic regression is right?
Logistic regression is ideal for the outcome which is categorical variable with two levels(binary, I.e, yes or no)
Logistic regression is ideal for the independent variables which are categorical variables with two levels(binary, I.e, yes or no)
Logistic regression is ideal for the model which contains only two predictors
Ultimately, the application of a Logistic regression will feel exactly same to multiple regression
None of these is right
