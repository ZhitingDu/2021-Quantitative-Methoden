Yes, it is linear, and a positive relationship
Yes, it is linear, and a negative relationship
No relationship can be found
None of these is right

2 We want to predict the linear relationship between study hour per day (x) and the final score (y). The equation is: y= 70+0.8x. If a student study 2 hours a day. What is the expected score he will have?

71.6
72.6
73.6
74.6
75.6

3 Which statement regarding residual is right ?

The smaller the residual is, the better the expectation is
Residual = Data + Fit
If an observation is above the regression line, the residual is negative
If an observation is under the regression line, the residual is positive
None of these is right

4 In this correlation plot, which one is the low positive correlation?

Left
Middle
Right
No positive correlation can be found
None of these is right

None of these is right


7 If x is the sample mean of the explanatory variable and y is the sample mean of the verticalvariable, then the point (x; y) is ?

On the least squares line
Above the least squares line
Under the least squares line
Can not know
None of these is right


8 What is the equation of the least squares regression line?
Variable x : 2,7,25,13,4,15,33,10,19,27
Variable y : 16,19,22,21,19,19,26,21,22,25

y= 0.26x+16.9
y= 0.26x-16.9
y= 0.36x-16.9
y= 0.36x+16.9
y= 0.36x+17.9


9 Which the following statement about R-squared is right ?

R-squared values range from 0 to 1 
The closer R-Squared is to 0 the better our model will be at predicting our dependent variable
R-squared = SSresidual/SStotal
R-squared = SStotal/SSresidual
None of these is right


10 In the following residual plots, which one is the plot we want to see when we evaluate how well a linear model fits a data set?

The fourth one
The third one
The second one
The first one
None of them

11 This data approach student achievement in secondary education. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features. G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. From the second plot, what can you know about the correlation ?

 Source from :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

The grade of each year has a high correlation among each other
Though the students have higher grade still has a positive correlation with failures
The good health can also help students have better grade
The more free time the students have, the better grade they will get
None of these is right



12 This data approach student achievement in secondary education. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features. G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. If the data is divided into two parts based on age, test sample is 30% of
 the total, train sample is the 70% of the total. We set up a model using the train data set. Which the following explanation is right ?

Source from :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

Absences can be seen have positive contribution for the prediction
G1, G2 can not be seen have positive contribution for the prediction
Age for the prediction have less influence
Overall, consider the result base on these all attributes, we can not have a good prediction for the final year grade
None of these is right

G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. If the data is divided into two parts based on age, test sample is 30% of the total, train sample is the 70% of the total. After setup the model, we want to evaluate how well this linear model fits the data set.  What can you know from this residual histogram ?

Source from :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

The residual plot displayed in a roughly normal distribution
Less extreme outliers can be found
These extreme outliers can not be seen as influential points
These extreme outliers can be directly removed
None of these is right



14  This data approach student achievement in secondary education. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features. G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. If the data is divided into two parts based on age, test sample is 30% of the total, train sample is the 70% of the total. Now we want to exam the model of the train sample with the test sample by using software. If the result is R square = 0.77. What das that mean?

Source from :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

The model can good fit to the data set
The model can exactly fit to the data set
The model can not fit to the data set
This result can not explain anything
None of these is right
