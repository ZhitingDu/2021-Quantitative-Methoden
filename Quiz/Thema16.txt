Arm 3



1 Multiple predictors - If the fitted model is: kid.score = 26 + 6 · mom.hs + 0.6 · mom.iq + error, under the condition of one of the predictor "mom.hs" remains unchanged, which of the following saying is right? (Reference can be found in ARM 3.2)

Changing maternal IQ from 100 to 101 would lead to an expected increase of 0.6 in child’s test
score.
Changing maternal IQ from 100 to 101 would lead to an expected increase of 6 in child’s test
score.
Changing maternal IQ from 100 to 101 would lead to an expected decrease of 0.6 in child’s test
score.
Changing maternal IQ from 100 to 101 would lead to an expected decrease of 6 in child’s test
score.
None of them is right


2 Interaction - If the fitted model is: kid.score = −11 + 51 · mom.hs + 1.1 · mom.iq − 0.5 · mom.hs · mom.iq + error, which of the following saying is right? (Reference can be found in ARM 3.3)

There is a interaction between mom.hs and mom.iq
This model has two predictors in this model, mom.hs and mom.iq
The regression lines of the model when mom.hs=0 and mom.hs=1 would be parallel
The coefficient 0.5 cannot represent the difference in the slope formom.iq, comparing the regression lines when mom.hs=0 and mom.hs=1
None of them is right
 


3 Statistical inference - In the model: kid.score = −11 + 51 · mom.hs + 1.1 · mom.iq − 0.5 · mom.hs · mom.iq + error, which of the following saying is right? (Reference can be found in ARM 3.4)

This model has four predictors
This model has four inputs
Error have independent normal distributions with mean=1
Error have dependent normal distributions with mean=1
None of them is right


4 Which the following saying is right?
(Reference can be found in ARM 3.4)

The fit of the model can be summarized by Residual standard deviation and Rsquared
The fit of the model can be summarized by Degrees of freedom and Rsquared
The larger the Residual standard deviation is, the more fit the model is
The larger the Rsquared is, the more fit the model is
None of them



5 Graphical displays of data and fitted model - if we want to plot two fitted regression lines with two imputes, which the following function would not be used? (Reference can be found in ARM 3.5)

sim()
plot()
curve()
lm()
None of them






6 Graphical displays of data and fitted model - if we want to represent the uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients (create simulations), which the following function would be used?
(Reference can be found in ARM 3.5)

sim()
plot()
curve()
lm()
None of them






7 If the model is y=abc, what is the best solution to transform the data to create the additivity?

(Reference can be found in ARM 3.6)

Logy = loga + logb + logc
y^2 = (abc)^2
1/y = 1/(abc)
y = log(a)*log(b)*log(c)
None of them





8 Which is a good way to check the assumption's importantly and linearity?
(Reference can be found in ARM 3.6)

Residual plot
Regression line plot
Outcome's distribution plot
Correlation plot
None of them



9 In the ARM book we have created linear model: fit3 (fit.3 <- lm (kid.score ~ mom.hs + mom.iq)), which of the following syntax is right if we want to predict this model in test dataset?

(Reference can be found in ARM 3.7)

predict(fit3, testdata)
predict(testdata, fit3)
lm(fit3, testdata)
lm(testdata, fit3)
None of them






10 Which the following term would be considered when make assumptions and diagnostic
Of regression model?
(Reference can be found in ARM 3.6 )

All of these
Independence of errors
Equal variance of errors
Validity
Additivity and Linearity
