Arm 4


1 Which the following saying regarding linear transformation is right ?
Reference can be found in ARM 4.1 

All of these
linear transformation will not affect the fit of a regression model
linear transformation will not affect the predictors
linear transformation can help to better interpret the coefficients
None of these


2 If we have a model: Score = 30 + 20 * study time + error, with a residual standard deviation of 800. Comparing to 800, the coefficient 20 can not precisely represent the difference of score when a difference of 1 unit in study time take place. To interpret the coefficients better, which the following scaling measures of predictors could we use?

Reference can be found in ARM 4.1 

All of these
Consider the standard deviation of studytime
Use "Z-score"
Use reasonable scales of inputs
None of these




3 Understanding Z-score. Which the following saying is right?
Reference can be found in ARM 4.1 

All of these
z = (x – μ)/σ, μ is the mean of the population. σ is the standard deviation of the population.
The standard deviation is the unit of measurement of the z-score
Z-score is a way to compare results to a “normal” population
None of these




4 What will happen if we standardise for models with interactions?
Reference can be found in ARM 4.2

None of these
Residual standard deviation will be changed
R2 will be changed
Coefficient for the interaction will be changed
The main effects and the intercept will stay the same




5 A single predict model: y=a+bx+error, if x and y are both standardised, which the following saying regarding "regression to the mean" is right?
Reference can be found in ARM 4.3

The regression slope range between -1 and 1
The regression intercept is the correlation between x and y 
x is predicted to be closer to the mean than y
None of these
All of these


6 To judge statistical significance, what can you tell from the following result?
Reference can be found in ARM 4.4


Predictors: fear, cons1 and extra2 have highly statistical significance
Predictors: extra1, open1 and open2 have highly statistical significance
Predictors: extra1 and neuro2 have highly statistical significance
None of these
Nothing can tell


7 Log transform supports which the following form?
Reference can be found in ARM 4.4


All of these
lm (Log (y) ~ log (x))
lm(y ~ log (x))
lm (Log (y) ~ x)
None of these




8  If study time =1 means no study everyday, study time =2 means study 1-3 hours everyday, study time =3 means study 4-5 hours everyday, which the following syntax is right, to fit a simple model using discrete predictors yields?
Reference can be found in ARM 4.5

lm(score ~ as.factor(study time), data = research)
lm(score ~ study time, data = research)
lm(score ~ log(study time), data = research)
lm(score ~ ln(study time), data = research)
None of these



9 Which the following saying is the general principles for building regression models for prediction?
Reference can be found in ARM 4.6

All of these
Include all input variables that, for substantive reasons, might be expected tobe important in predicting the outcome.
It is not always necessary to include these inputs as separate predictors—forexample, sometimes several inputs can be averaged or summed to create a “totalscore” that can be used as a single predictor in the model.
For inputs that have large effects, consider including their interactions as well.
None of these
